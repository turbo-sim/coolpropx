Welcome to CoolPropX's documentation!
=====================================


``CoolPropX`` is a thin wrapper around the `CoolProp <https://www.coolprop.org>`_ fluid property library that provides easy access to its low-level interface, along with several convenient utilities to:

- Compute and plot phase envelopes and spinodal lines for pure fluids.
- Evaluate thermodynamic properties from the Helmholtz energy equation of state, including metastable states inside the two-phase region.
- Perform flash calculations for any input pair with a custom solver with user-defined initial guesses.
- Access structured property dictionaries and immutable ``FluidState`` objects.
- Evaluate properties over arrays of input conditions for efficient parametric studies and plotting.
