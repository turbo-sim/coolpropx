## Key features

- Compute and plot phase envelopes and spinodal lines for pure fluids.
- Evaluate thermodynamic properties from Helmholtz energyâ€“based equations of state, including metastable states inside the two-phase region.
- Perform flash calculations for any input pair with a custom solver and user-defined initial guesses.
- Work with structured property dictionaries and immutable `FluidState` objects.
- Evaluate properties over arrays of input conditions for efficient parametric studies and plotting.
- Full JAX compatibility: supports `jit`, `grad`, `vmap`, and parallel evaluation.

## Installation

```bash
pip install jaxprop
